Hey, there my name is Founntain!
A bit about myself: I'm currently `currentYear - 1999` years old and from Germany. 
Currently, I am working for a medium-sized software development company as Software Consultant.

**Languages I use:**
+ C# *(For most of my projects)*
+ HTML, CSS and Typescript *(for web stuff)*
+ Java *(mostly for Minecraft plugin development)*

In 2016 I had my first programming contact at my IT-School. There we mostly developed in Java, but all stuff that we programmed in Java I tried to implement in C#
while learning it on my own.  

In 2017 I started development on the first versions of the osu!player in WPF and .NET-Framework 4.6. It looked bad, it felt bad and badly performed.
But let's be honest what do expect from someone who never used WPF at all and did not have much C# experience? 
On the 1st of November 2017, the first version of the osu!player was released on the osu! forum.  

After a while, Cesan joined me and we started working on it together now and I'm grateful for that. *Thanks buddy*

Hi, I'm Cesan. You can also call me Caro if you want ^^

I'm a self-taught C# dev and currently studying Applied Computer Sciences at University.
I also work as an embedded C dev in the meantime.

I mostly use C# for everything I do because I think it's the most versatile and practical language for desktop development.
In university, I learned C and Java. However I would never use Java personally.

When I joined the development team of the osu!player, I mostly did design stuff in WPF as I understood it best, but now we both do more or less the same stuff because we have quite some experience with the osu!player by now, to make the player look and feel like how it is today.

Thanks for reading and have fun with the player, cheers.
