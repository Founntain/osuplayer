This is the *official* **osu!player** (Avalonia) repository and is mainly developed by [@Founntain](https://github.com/Founntain), with help of [@Cesan](https://github.com/Cesan).  
This repository will be a complete rewrite of osu!player plus, so keep in mind this is all *work in progress*, with the *ultimate goal to go cross-platform*.  
So if we speak osu!player in this repository we mean the Avalonia (this) version. If you want to refer to other versions of the osu!player mention them by their name, either *osu!player **plus*** or *osu!player **legacy*** (osu!player versions before the plus).  

osu!player is a music player for *osu!* with the focus of playing your osu! songs **without having to start osu!**.

If you want to contribute, feel free to fork this repository, read the [contributing information](https://github.com/Founntain/osuplayer.git) and head to the [official osu!player discord](https://discord.gg/RJQSc5B) (not mandetory, but helpful).
